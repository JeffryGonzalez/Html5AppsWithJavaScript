#Create a Math Tutor

Using the techniques we learned in class, including:

  - jQuery Plugins
  - Unit Testing with Jasmine
  - Prototyping
  
Create an app that presents the user with a math quiz.

When opening the app, the user with be presented with a sequece of basic math questions, such as:

  - What is 2 + 2?
  - What is 15 / 3?
  - What is 8 * 3?

For each question, the user will be prompted for an answer. 

If their answer is the correct answer, they move onto the next question

If their answer is incorrect, they will be asked to guess again.

A total of three wrong answers ends the game and they are told they lose.

If the user guesses each answer correctly, they are told they are a winner.

## Extra Credit

Make it a timed game. They have 3 minutes to complete the quiz.
